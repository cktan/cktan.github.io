  <h2>Date Dimension Table in Postgres</h2>

  <article>
    <p>One of the first dimension tables required for any Data Warehouse project is
the Date Dimension table. See <a href="http://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/calendar-date-dimension/">Calendar Date Dimensions @kimballgroup</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>We want our date dimension table to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Column             | Type | Description 
------------------ | ---- | ----------- 
date_key           | int  | A number corresponding to the date. e.g. 20150315. 
date               | date | SQL date. 
y                  | int  | Year in number, e.g. 2015. 
m                  | int  | Month in number (1..12). 
d                  | int  | Day of month (1..31). 
q                  | int  | Quarter (1..4). 
h                  | int  | First / second half of year (1 or 2). 
dow                | int  | Day of week (1..7). 
doy                | int  | Day of year (1..366). 
yow                | int  | Year of week.
                   |      |  Can be different from y only during first week of the year. 
woy                | int  | Week of year (1..52).
                   |      | Note: first few days of the year may be week 52 of last year. 
doe                | int  | Day of epoch, a serial number. 
woe                | int  | Week of epoch, a serial number. 
moe                | int  | Month of epoch, a serial number. 
yoe                | int  | Year of epoch, a serial number. 
is_weekday         | bool | True if Mon..Fri. 
is_weekend         | bool | True if Sat..Sun. 
first_date_of_week | date | Date of Monday of this week. 
last_date_of_week  | date | Date of Sunday of this week. 
yw                 | text | e.g. 2015-W5 for week 5 of 2015. 
ym                 | text | e.g. 2015-12 for December 2015. 
yq                 | text | e.g. 2015-Q4 for Q4 of 2015. 
is_holiday         | bool | Holiday indicator.
</code></pre>

<p>The SQL statement follows. A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can edit section <code>DR1</code> to set the starting date and the range of
your date dimension. In the code below, we start generating dates
from year 2000 through 2030.</li>
<li>A week starts from Monday (1) and ends on Sunday (7).</li>
<li>The first week of the year usually belongs to the previous year. For
example, on January 1, 2000, the year-of-week is 1999, and the week-of-year is 52.</li>
<li>You should add columns to this table to mark special dates such as
holidays and significant events of the company.</li>
</ul>
